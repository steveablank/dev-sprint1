1.  What is a route, and how do you specify one in Flask?
	A route maps URLs to application functions/locations- it's what gets returned from a get request.  

2. What is the only route we've specified in our application?
-->	@app.route('/')
	def index():
		return 'Index Page'

3. What is the method that gets called when we hit that route?
	@app.route('/hello')
-->	def hello():
-->		return 'Hello World'

4. If I wanted to add a route at "/world" that printed "Hello, World" on the screen, what would that code look like?

	@app.route("/world")
	def hello():
		return "Hello World!"

5. If I create a new application and import testingflask.py (a.k.a. I am not running it directly), will code under the "if__name__=="__main__": be excecuted?  Why not?

No, "__main__" refers to the default/current module- in order for it to pull correctly from testingflask.py, it would need to pull using a specific name (__testingflask__) instead.


6. What is the 'base case' where we don't call 'blastoff' again?
if n<=0:
The return statement then exits the function.

7. What is the 'simpler' form of our input ('n') that we pass into 'blastoff'?
if n>0, print the number, then count down by 1, repeat until zero is reached, then print 'Blastoff!'

*** Cut and paste the for loop here ***
		{% with messages = get_flashed_messages() %}
			{% if messages %}
				<br>
				Results:
				<pre>
					{% for message in messages %}
{{message}}
					{% endfor %}
				</pre>
				{% endif %}
			{% endwith %}
